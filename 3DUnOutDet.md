# CADC Annotations
We split the CADC dataset into three sets: training, validation and testing. Testing set has 32 sequences. 
One research engineer had annotated 2 testing sequences from CADC which were reviewed by one doctoral candidate. With that 2 labeled sequences, we trained 3D-OutDet to produce annotations for the remaining 30 sequences from our test set.
